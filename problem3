// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only
Approach:
1. Take lower_bound = 0, and upper_bound = 1 and check if the target is less than arr[high]
2. If yes, then perform binary search and return the index.
3. If no, double the upper_bound until
    - an exception is thrown. 
    - target lies in between lower_bound and upper_bound
4. Once the lower_bound and upper_bound are determined, perform binary search and return the index.
5. If not found, then return -1
